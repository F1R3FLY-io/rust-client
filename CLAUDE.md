## LLM Development Philosophy

This project follows Smart Assets' **document-first development** approach. The AI Coding Philosophy document gives complete details.

```

### Key Principles

1. **Stigmergic Collaboration**: Coordinate with other agents through shared `.md` files
2. **Document-First**: Create design docs and specifications BEFORE implementation
3. **Signal vs. Slop**: Maximize code that solves problems. Avoid over-engineering.
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Define measurable success criteria in task definitions

### Standard Document Structure

| Document | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| User Stories | Business needs and acceptance criteria | `docs/UserStories.md` |
| Tasks/Epics | Implementation tracking | `docs/ToDos.md` |
| Completed Work | Historical reference | `docs/CompletedTasks.md` |
| Backlog | Deferred items | `docs/Backlog.md` |
| Work Logs | Session progress | `docs/work-logs/*.md` |
| Discoveries | Shared findings | `docs/discoveries/*.md` |

## Stigmergic Collaboration

This project uses **stigmergic collaboration** - agents coordinate through shared `.md` files rather than direct messaging. When agents work as a Claude Code agent team, real-time IPC replaces file-based coordination. The stigmergic files remain for cross-session continuity, audit trails, and cross-tool interoperability.

```

### Before Starting Work

1. **Read `docs/ToDos.md`** to check task status and claims
2. **Check `docs/work-logs/`** for existing progress on related tasks
3. **Review `docs/discoveries/`** for relevant context from other agents

### When Claiming a Task

Update the task in `docs/ToDos.md`:

```yaml
---
id: TASK-001
status: in_progress          # Changed from 'pending'
claimed_by: claude-session-a1b2c3  # See Implementer Identification format
claimed_at: 2025-01-15T10:00:00Z
# Other valid claimed_by formats:
#   human-jeff@example.com        # Human (git config --get user.email)
#   design-sprint/researcher      # Agent team member ({team}/{name})
---
```

### During Work

1. **Create work log** at `docs/work-logs/task-{id}-{timestamp}.md`
2. **Document discoveries** in `docs/discoveries/` for other agents
3. **Update blockers** if you encounter dependencies

### Before Pausing/Completing

Update your work log with handoff notes:

```yaml
---
handoff_status: ready | paused | blocked
next_steps:
  - What remains to be done
---
```

### Document-First Workflow

For significant features:

1. **User Story**: Capture the business need in `docs/UserStories.md`
   - Define persona, capability, and benefit
   - List acceptance criteria

2. **Design Document**: Describe problem and solution
   ```bash
   cp ../../SA/top-level-gitlab-profile/docs/templates/design-doc.md.template docs/designs/[feature-name].md
   ```

3. **Specification**: Define interfaces and behavior
   ```bash
   cp ../../SA/top-level-gitlab-profile/docs/templates/specification.md.template docs/specs/[component-name].md
   ```

4. **Task Definition**: Add epic to `docs/ToDos.md` with tasks

5. **Implement**: Only after documentation is reviewed

6. **Complete**: Update user story status when epic completes

## AI Artifact Generation Guidelines

**Core strategy:** Default to **Markdown + Mermaid** as the source of truth for all generated artifacts. Use **HTML** only when high engagement or advanced interactivity is required.

**Preferred formats:**

| Format | Use for | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Markdown + Mermaid** | Primary. Diagrams (flowcharts, sequences, architecture, timelines, Gantt, ERDs), structured documents, plans, specs | Relative links (`./images/`, `./docs/`) and GitHub/GitLab raw URLs for local/cloud asset referencing |
| **HTML (CSS/JS + embedded Mermaid)** | Secondary. Interactive dashboards, prototypes, dynamic reviews, stakeholder deliverables | When visual polish and engagement are critical (tabs, sliders, clickable elements) |

**Hybrid rule:** Always produce Markdown as the canonical, Git-friendly version first. Generate a self-contained HTML export on request.

**Key principles:**

- Prioritize human readability, editability, and Git compatibility (clean diffs, relative paths, native rendering on GitHub/GitLab).
- Maximize information density while avoiding text walls — convert complex information into Mermaid diagrams.
- Support seamless referencing of local files and cloud artifacts (images, other docs, raw Git content).
- Favor Markdown for internal/agent use and long-term storage (token efficiency).
- Use HTML when delivering to stakeholders or for living documents (engagement).

**Output guidance:** When creating artifacts, ask whether HTML interactivity is needed. Default to clean Markdown with embedded Mermaid unless specified.

## Simplified Technical English
<!-- ste-policy: full -->

Smart Assets uses ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English, Issue 9, dated January 2025, for applicable English technical prose.

This policy is a Smart Assets applicability profile. The ASD standard remains the authoritative source for its rules and controlled dictionary.

Get the current standard from the [official ASD-STE100 website](https://www.asd-ste100.org/) or its [official downloads page](https://www.asd-ste100.org/STE_downloads.html).

ASD owns the standard and the ASD-STE100 trademark. Do not copy its controlled dictionary, examples, or substantial rule text into this repository.

## UI Test Assertions

React UI tests must prove user-observable DOM structure and state. Do not test incidental copy or formatted sample values.
Use exact text or value assertions only when the test covers copy, formatting, or content transformation.

- **Preferred:** Use accessibility-first queries for DOM elements and states. Examples include roles, labels, focus state, and ARIA relationships.
- **Preferred:** Assert semantic regions/components are present and wired correctly (tabs, tabpanels, dialogs, forms, buttons, lists), then assert behavior through state changes or callback/data-source calls.
- **Acceptable:** Use `data-testid` when no accessible handle exists. You can also use it for presentational elements or stable component boundaries.
- **Acceptable:** HTML `id` attributes for form elements and ARIA relationships.
- **Avoid:** `getByText`/`queryByText` for literal strings that are merely display copy, repeated metrics, formatted numbers, or mock-data values.
- **Avoid:** Do not use `getAllByText(...).length` as a substitute for a meaningful DOM assertion. It couples tests to duplicated visual text instead of behavior.
- **Avoid:** CSS class selectors that may change with styling updates.

Examples:

```tsx
// GOOD: accessibility-first DOM element + state
expect(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Refresh agents" })).toBeEnabled();

// ACCEPTABLE: fallback when no accessible role/name fits
expect(screen.getByTestId("cost-optimization-panel")).toBeInTheDocument();

// GOOD for data-flow behavior: verify source + rendered component boundary,
// not a duplicated metric string like "7.5%".
expect(fetchQualityPipeline).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
expect(screen.getByRole("tablist", { name: "Quality Pipeline tabs" })).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getByRole("tab", { name: /overview/i })).toHaveAttribute("aria-selected", "true");

// BAD: brittle copy assertion
expect(screen.getByText("Priority set by BountyForge routing")).toBeInTheDocument();

// BAD: brittle mock-value / duplicated visual text assertion
expect(screen.getByText("7.5%")).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getAllByText("7.5%").length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
```

**When exact text is appropriate:** Use exact text assertions only when the acceptance criteria is about user-facing copy, accessibility name computation, validation messages, formatting rules, or transformed content. Prefer scoping with `within(...)` to a semantic container so the assertion remains tied to the behavior under test.

## Worktree Policy

Git worktrees are an **agentic-mode-only** tool in this workspace. In safe /
interactive mode:

- **NEVER create a git worktree** unless the user explicitly asks for one in
  their own words. This covers every creation path equally: `git worktree add`,
  harness-native tools (e.g. an `EnterWorktree` tool, subagent
  `isolation: "worktree"`, workflow worktree isolation), and any script that
  wraps them.
- All work happens in the single main checkout on the current branch.
- `git worktree list` is read-only and permitted.
- `git worktree remove` and `git worktree prune` require explicit user
  confirmation.

**Why:** worktrees fragment local state, are invisible to `/recursive-push`
repository discovery, and were the root cause of an accidental push to a
protected branch. A worktree created silently by an assistant is a worktree
nobody pushes, cleans up, or audits.

**Exception:** In agentic mode (`claude-agentic`), all restrictions are lifted.
YOLO mode runs *inside* a worktree that the human created. Running in a worktree
never authorizes the creation of more worktrees.

Canonical policy: Git Interaction Policy, Worktrees section.

```

## Cross-Repository References

Use the reference form that matches the location of the target. The Cross-Reference Standards document contains the full rules.

| Target | Required form |
| --- | --- |
| File in the same repository | Document-relative Markdown link |
| Current guidance in another repository | `yaml cross-reference` block or `cross_references` frontmatter with `purpose: current` |
| Evidence or an approved decision | Record with `purpose: evidence` and a full commit ID |

Obey these rules when you write a record:

- Set `checkout` relative to the directory of the source document.
- Set `path` relative to the root of the target repository.
- Take the hosted project path from the configured remote or from `repo-mapping.yaml`. Local directory names and hosted project names can be different.
- Set `revision` to the branch that holds the current content. Do not assume `master` or `main`.
- Do not write a Markdown link to a file in another repository. A single-repository clone cannot resolve that link, and the CI link check fails.
- Before you commit, run `uv run --script scripts/check-broken-links.py --references-only` from the top-level profile on each changed Markdown file.

Do not copy the link form of older text. Older text can contain the two-label form that version 2 of the standard replaced.

  url: https://gitlab.com/smart-assets.io/gitlab-profile/-/blob/master/docs/common/cross-reference-standards.md
```

### Configuration File Conventions

When creating or modifying configuration files, follow these conventions to respect existing project preferences:

**JSON Format Preference Order:**

1. **Check for existing files first**: Before creating any `.json` file, check if `.jsonc` or `.json5` variants exist
2. **Prefer existing format**: If `config.jsonc` or `config.json5` exists, use that format instead of creating `config.json`
3. **Default to JSONC**: When creating new config files, prefer `.jsonc` (JSON with Comments) for better maintainability

**Why This Matters:**
- Projects may have established preferences for comment-supporting JSON formats
- Creating duplicate configs (e.g., both `biome.json` and `biome.jsonc`) causes confusion
- JSONC allows inline documentation which improves maintainability

**Examples:**

| If this exists... | Do not create this... | Use this action... |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| `biome.jsonc` | `biome.json` | Edit the existing `biome.jsonc` |
| `tsconfig.json5` | `tsconfig.json` | Edit the existing `tsconfig.json5` |
| `eslint.config.jsonc` | `eslint.config.json` | Edit the existing file |
| Nothing | - | Create new file as `.jsonc` when comments are useful |

**File Discovery Pattern:**

Before creating any config file, check for variants:
```bash
# Check for config variants (example for biome)
ls biome.json biome.jsonc biome.json5 2>/dev/null
```

This applies to all slash commands and scripts that create configuration files.

### Slash Commands
<!-- SYNC:standard -->

The workspace `AItools` directory in the top-level profile provides the following slash commands. The Slash Command Requirements document defines them.

```yaml cross-reference
reference:
  purpose: current
  repository: https://gitlab.com/smart-assets.io/gitlab-profile
  checkout: ../../SA/top-level-gitlab-profile
  revision: master
  path: docs/common/slash-command-requirements.md
  url: https://gitlab.com/smart-assets.io/gitlab-profile/-/blob/master/docs/common/slash-command-requirements.md
```

#### Git Operations
- `/quick-commit` - Stage and commit changes (required in safe mode)
- `/recursive-push` - Push across repositories

#### Task Management
- `/nextTask` - Find and select next task to work on
- `/implement` - Begin implementation of a task
- `/epic-review` - Preview and summarize epics
- `/epic-hygiene` - Archive completed epics

#### Workspace Sync
- `/harmonize` - Sync workspace policies into this repo
- `/multi-repo-sync` - Workspace-wide sync orchestration

[OPTIONAL_COMMANDS]

## Development Modes
<!-- SYNC:standard -->

This project supports three operational modes for AI-assisted development.

| Mode | Command | Git Access |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Safe** | `claude` / `claude-safe` | Via `/quick-commit`, `/recursive-push` only |
| **Agentic** | `claude-agentic` | Direct git permitted |
| **YOLO** | `claude-agentic` (in user-created worktree) | Full autonomy, isolated |

**Safe mode** is the default. Use slash commands for all git operations.
**Agentic mode** requires branch consistency (`check-repo-consistency.sh --strict`).
**YOLO mode** requires a git worktree for isolation. The human creates the worktree. Agents never create worktrees outside agentic mode (see Worktree Policy).

## PII Guidelines for Contributors

**CRITICAL - Before submitting any contribution:**

Contributors MUST ensure their code, commits, and documentation do NOT contain PII:

**Check before committing:**
- [ ] No absolute file paths with usernames in code or documentation
- [ ] No personal email addresses in code (use generic examples like `user@example.com`)
- [ ] No real user data in tests or examples (use synthetic/fake data only)
- [ ] No PII in log statements (sanitize or use user IDs instead)
- [ ] No PII in error messages or stack traces
- [ ] No PII in code comments or documentation
- [ ] No credentials, tokens, or secrets in code (use environment variables)
- [ ] No IP addresses, MAC addresses, or device identifiers in examples

**If you accidentally committed PII:**
1. **DO NOT** push to remote repository
2. Use `git reset` to remove the commit
3. If already pushed, contact maintainers immediately
4. Repository history may need to be rewritten to remove PII

**Use these instead:**
- File paths: Use relative paths or generic placeholders (`[WORKSPACE_ROOT]/project/`)
- Email addresses: Use `user@example.com`, `admin@example.com`
- Names: Use `John Doe`, `Jane Smith`, `User123`
- Phone numbers: Use `+1-555-0100` (officially reserved for examples)
- IP addresses: Use reserved ranges (`192.0.2.1`, `198.51.100.1`, `203.0.113.1`)
- Dates: Use recent but generic dates, not specific personal dates

**For test data:**
- Use test data generators that create realistic but fake data
- Use well-known test fixtures (e.g., `test@example.com`)
- Never use production or real user data in development/testing

## grepai - Semantic Code Search

`grepai` is an optional, MIT-licensed semantic-search tool. If it is installed
and indexed locally for this repo, prefer it for intent-based code exploration.
If it is unavailable, use your harness's native search and file-reading tools.
The tool is recommended but never required. Nothing here is harness-specific -
substitute your tool's equivalents for the generic actions described below.
Setup (with the privacy-first local Ollama embedder as default) lives in the
CLI Setup guide's "Optional: Semantic Code Search (grepai)" section.

# important-instruction-reminders
- Do only the requested work.
- Do not create a file unless it is necessary to complete the request.
- Prefer an edit to an existing file instead of a new file.
- Create a documentation file only when the user explicitly requests it.
- Before code changes, state the files, the method, and the assumptions.
- Wait for user confirmation before you make a code change.
- For a simple single-file edit, a one-line summary is sufficient.
